// This class is part of the common project meaning it is shared between all supported loaders. Code written here can only

// common compatible binaries. This means common code can not directly use loader specific concepts such as Forge events
// however it will be compatible with all supported mod loaders.

    // The loader specific projects are able to import and use any code from the common project. This allows you to

        // It is common for all supported loaders to provide a similar feature that can not be used directly in the
        // common code. A popular way to get around this is using Java's built-in service loader feature to create
        // your own abstraction layer. You can learn more about this in our provided services class. In this example
        // we have an interface in the common code and use a loader specific implementation to delegate our call to
        // the platform specific approach.
